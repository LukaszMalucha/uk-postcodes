        I am so proud of my wife Agata. Over a year ago, I convinced her to start learning to code in Python. New beginnings are never easy, but she stayed on the path, building several family-useful applications along the way. Earlier this year, she decided to get her Python diploma at UCD and she is currently building her final project. There is no greater reward than seeing her seriously engaged and focused on this task.
